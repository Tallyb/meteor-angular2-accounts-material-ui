## Style Guide

For the coding style guide, we use AirBnB [rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with TypeScript specifics and max line width set to 100 symbols. Rules are partly enforced by the tslint.json file in the root (if you are not familiar with TSLint, read more [here](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)). Please, check that your code conforms with the rules before PR.
